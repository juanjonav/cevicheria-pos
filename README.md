## Overview

Overview

This project is a minimal Point of Sale (POS) and inventory system designed for a small restaurant (cevichería). It allows basic management of menu items, customer orders, stock usage, expenses, and sales history.
The purpose of this MVP is to demonstrate core concepts of accounting, costs, and cash flow, including revenue tracking, purchase registration, inventory control, and cash balance reporting.

The system includes:

Menu and category management

Order creation with automatic stock consumption

Payment registration (cash, card, transfer)

Expense tracking for operational costs and purchase of supplies

Basic inventory management and movement logs

Daily/weekly cash flow calculation (Ingresos – Gastos)

This project uses Next.js 16, Prisma ORM, PostgreSQL, and TypeScript.
It is intentionally simple and focused on being clear, functional, and easy to analyze for academic purposes.
